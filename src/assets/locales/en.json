        "It all started with the one-week Front-End development marathon in Ukrainian IT school. As part of the marathon, we had to create a CV page, according to the layout from Figma.com. Even during the marathon, I became very interested in the additional features of HTML and CSS. The marathon was over, but the interest was only growing.",
        "I am so lucky that I have a friend who has been working as a Front-End developer for many years. So, I decided to ask questions and consult with him.",
        "My friend suggested to make another maquette from the Figma website, but already with him as a mentor. Of course, I couldn't refuse, because I was very interested. That's how the project with the simple name 'Stage 1' has appeared.",
        "I learned a lot while working on this project. For example, I studied pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes better, I started to get acquainted with simple animations, learned additional HTML capabilities.",
        "To make a mobile version of the page I dealt with media requests.",
        "It gradually came to JavaScript. And at that moment I realized that everything is more interesting than it seemed to me before.",
        "At this project, the presence of JS was kept to a minimum because there was practically no need for it.",
        "But the key achievement of this project was that I became even more interested (the number of open tabs with requests for \"how to do \"something\" on Google was inexorably increasing)."

        "One day my mentor told me - \"Finish with this layout and let's move on\".",
        "The task for the new project was to get acquainted with the library for JS - React and the transition from CSS to SASS (for experiments, a new layout was taken from the Figma site).",
        "Half an hour on YouTube + a few (dozens) of open tabs with Google searches and I got down to business.",
        "It was difficult at first, but it only made me more interested, because I always get more interested when I don't understand something and I need to figure out how it works.",
        "Gradually, I got acquainted with the structure of the React project, with hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect and useCallback), I began to understand the specifics of React work (when renderings take place, etc.), I tried (successfully) to use Context (to change themes) and became friends with SASS.",
        "Once, when I already \"felt my strength\" a little, I decided to try to write my own slider for one of the components (in the first project, I used the ready-made slider code and simply rewrote it a little for my needs). I was very happy when something working came out.",
        "Then my friend named \"Mentor\", advised me to study server requests. He offered me several API options so that I could request data there - this is how I got acquainted with asynchronous functions in JS and learned how to process GET requests.",
        "The next step was Redux...",
        "Although I understood how it works, I couldn't figure out how to add Redux to the project.",
        "But this beast was also defeated. I used RTK (Redux Toolkit) for GET requests.",
        "In this project, I learned a lot for myself and was very inspired by the React library. The combination of HTML and JS is exactly what I am very interested in working with."
